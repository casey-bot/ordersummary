## WHOOPS
I accidentally deleted the readme template.

## STRUGGLES
I'm still really struggling to understand grid display but I think I'm getting a better handle on flexbox. The are with the icon/annual plan/price info gave me the most trouble. 

I also struggled a bit with the background. In trying to line up the background with the example images I may have included some unecessary code. Idk! 

If anything looks a bit off it's totally just because I need glasses.

## BUILT WITH
CSS and HTML idk anything else yet :) using visual studio code as a text editor

## THANKS
